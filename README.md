# DES-Helper
Small helper program for calculating various subtasks within the DES algorithm like initial/final permutations, S-boxes, and e-bit permutations. Its functionality is quite restrictive/limited with respect to its input and format capabilities, so please read through the code before using it. The ```main``` function can be altered to fit your needs; there are some examples there you can use as reference.

Made with Python3 and libraries like numpy and pandas.
